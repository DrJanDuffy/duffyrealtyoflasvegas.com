      questions: [
        {
          q: 'What is a buyer\'s agent?',
          a: 'A buyer\'s agent is a licensed real estate professional who represents your interests throughout the home buying process. Unlike the builder\'s sales team, who work for the builder, a buyer\'s agent works exclusively for you, providing advocacy, contract review, negotiation, and expert guidance—all at no additional cost to you. They protect your interests and ensure you make informed decisions.',
        },
        {
          q: 'Do I need a buyer\'s agent to buy a Beazer home?',
          a: 'While not required, working with a buyer\'s agent like Dr. Jan Duffy provides significant benefits. You get professional representation, contract review, negotiation, and expert guidance—all at no additional cost to you. Beazer welcomes buyer\'s agent representation. A buyer\'s agent is especially valuable for new construction because builder contracts are complex and favor the builder.',
        },
        {
          q: 'Do I pay extra to work with a buyer\'s agent?',
          a: 'No. The real estate commission structure means buyer\'s agent representation comes at no additional cost to you. The commission splits happen on the builder\'s side regardless of whether you work with an agent. By working with Dr. Jan Duffy, you get professional representation and advocacy at no extra expense.',
        },
        {
          q: 'What if I already started working with the builder\'s sales team?',
          a: 'In many cases, you can still bring in a buyer\'s agent even if you\'ve already been working with the builder\'s sales team. Contact Dr. Jan Duffy immediately—the sooner she\'s involved, the better she can help you. She can step in to provide representation and ensure your interests are protected, even if you\'ve already visited communities.',
        },
        {
          q: 'What does a buyer\'s agent do during the new construction process?',
          a: 'A buyer\'s agent provides comprehensive support throughout the entire process: helping you choose the right community and floor plan, reviewing and negotiating the purchase contract, coordinating design center selections, attending construction walkthroughs, ensuring quality standards are met, coordinating with lenders and title companies, and handling closing details. Dr. Jan Duffy manages all of this for you.',

          a: 'Construction timelines typically range from 4-8 months, depending on whether the home is already under construction, a standard build, or custom. Quick move-in homes (already under construction) can close in 30-90 days. Standard new builds take 4-6 months from contract to closing. Your buyer\'s agent will help you plan accordingly and manage expectations throughout the process.',

          q: 'Can I customize a Beazer home?',

        },
        {
          q: 'What happens if there are delays in construction?',
          a: 'Delays can happen due to weather, supply chain issues, permit delays, or other factors. Your purchase contract will outline how delays are handled and what protections you have.

She\'ll keep you informed throughout the process.',
        },
        {
          q: 'Can I visit my home during construction?',
          a: 'Yes, you\'ll typically have scheduled walkthroughs at key stages: framing walkthrough, pre-drywall inspection, and final walkthrough before closing. The builder will coordinate these visits. Dr. Jan Duffy will attend walkthroughs with you to ensure quality, verify that selected upgrades are installed correctly, and address any concerns. Unscheduled visits are usually not permitted for safety reasons.',
        },
        {
          q: 'What is a quick move-in home?',
          a: 'Quick move-in homes are homes that are already under construction or completed and available for immediate or near-immediate occupancy. These homes typically close within 30-90 days, making them ideal if you need to move quickly. You may have limited customization options since construction has already progressed, but you can still select some finishes if timing allows.',
        },
        {
          q: 'When should I sell my current home?',
          a: 'This depends on your situation and the timeline for your new Beazer home. If buying a quick move-in home, you may need to sell quickly.

Dr. Jan Duffy can help you create a timeline that works for your situation.',

    {
      category: 'Inspections & Quality',
      questions: [
        {
          q: 'Do I need a home inspection for new construction?',
          a: 'Yes, absolutely. Even though it\'s new construction, inspections are important. You\'ll want inspections at key stages: pre-drywall (to see behind the walls), and final inspection before closing. Inspections can catch issues early when they\'re easier to fix. Dr. Jan Duffy will coordinate inspections and ensure any issues are properly documented and addressed.',
        },
        {
          q: 'What if I find problems during the final walkthrough?',
          a: 'The final walkthrough is designed to identify any issues before closing. Any defects, incomplete work, or items not matching your selections should be documented in writing. The builder will address these items before closing. Dr. Jan Duffy will ensure all issues are properly documented, negotiate with the builder to resolve them, and verify everything is completed to your satisfaction before you close.',

        {
          q: 'What warranties come with a new Beazer home?',

      questions: [
        {
          q: 'How much down payment do I need?',

FHA loans require 3.5% minimum, conventional loans can be as low as 3% for qualified first-time buyers, and VA loans offer 0% down for eligible veterans. The down payment amount affects your monthly payment and may impact whether you need private mortgage insurance (PMI).

        {
          q: 'What are closing costs?',
          a: 'Closing costs include lender fees, title insurance, appraisal, inspection, prepaid items (property taxes, insurance, HOA fees), and various other fees. They typically total 2-5% of the home\'s purchase price. Some builders, including Beazer, may offer incentives to help cover closing costs. Your buyer\'s agent will review all closing costs with you, help you understand each fee, and negotiate where possible.',
        },
        {
          q: 'Do I need a different type of loan for new construction?',
          a: 'For homes already under construction or completed (quick move-in), standard mortgages work. For homes that haven\'t started building yet, you may need a construction-to-permanent loan, which converts to a traditional mortgage after construction. Some builders, including Beazer, have preferred lenders who specialize in new construction financing. Dr. Jan Duffy can connect you with experienced lenders.',
        },
        {
          q: 'What about HOA fees?',
          a: 'Many Beazer Homes communities have homeowners associations (HOAs) that provide community amenities and maintenance. HOA fees vary by community and typically range from $50-$300+ per month. Fees cover things like landscaping, common areas, pools, and other amenities. Your buyer\'s agent will provide HOA information for each community and help you factor these costs into your budget.',
        },
        {
          q: 'What are property taxes in Las Vegas?',
          a: 'Nevada property taxes are relatively low compared to many states. In Clark County (Las Vegas area), the average effective property tax rate is around 0.6-0.7% of assessed value. New construction homes are assessed based on purchase price. Property taxes can be paid directly or included in your monthly mortgage payment through an escrow account.
