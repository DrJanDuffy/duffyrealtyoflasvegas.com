# Performance Optimizations Applied

## Overview

Based on the speed test results, several performance optimizations have been implemented to improve Core Web Vitals scores, particularly focusing on Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) and Time to Interactive (TTI).

## Speed Test Baseline

- **Performance Score**: 88/100
- **LCP**: 2,807ms (target: <2,500ms)
- **TTI**: 4,062ms (target: <3,800ms)
- **TBT**: 321ms (target: <300ms)
- **FCP**: 1,738ms (good)
- **CLS**: 0 (excellent - no layout shifts)

## Optimizations Implemented

### 1. Font Loading Optimization (`app/layout.tsx`)

**Changes:**
- Added `display: 'swap'` to both fonts for better font loading
- Set `preload: true` for primary font (Geist Sans)
- Set `preload: false` for secondary font (Geist Mono)

**Impact:** Reduces render-blocking and improves FCP by allowing text to display with fallback fonts immediately.

### 2. Image Optimization (`app/page.tsx`)

**Changes:**
- Added `loading="lazy"` to all non-critical images
- Added `sizes` attribute for responsive images: `(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 50vw`
- All images now properly lazy-load below the fold

**Impact:** Significantly improves LCP by deferring non-critical image loading.

### 3. Next.js Image Configuration (`next.config.ts`)

**Changes:**
- Added AVIF and WebP format support (more efficient than JPEG)
- Configured device sizes for responsive images
- Set minimum cache TTL to 60 seconds
- Added package import optimization for lucide-react

**Impact:** Smaller image file sizes and better caching reduce bandwidth and improve load times.

### 4. Google Analytics Optimization (`app/layout.tsx`)

**Changes:**
- Changed script loading strategy from `afterInteractive` to `lazyOnload`
- Analytics now loads after page is fully interactive

**Impact:** Reduces TBT (Total Blocking Time) and improves TTI by not blocking main thread.

### 5. Structured Data Component (`components/StructuredData.tsx`)

**Changes:**
- Created reusable component for structured data
- Cleaner, more maintainable code
- No performance impact, but better organization

### 6. Font Family Fix (`app/globals.css`)

**Changes:**
- Changed from `font-mono` to `font-sans` for body
- Updated HTML font-family to use sans-serif stack
- More appropriate for real estate website readability

**Impact:** Better typography performance and user experience.

## Expected Performance Improvements

### Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
- **Target**: <2,500ms
- **Current**: 2,807ms
- **Expected**: ~2,300-2,400ms (lazy loading images, font optimization)

### Time to Interactive (TTI)
- **Target**: <3,800ms
- **Current**: 4,062ms
- **Expected**: ~3,500-3,700ms (lazy loading analytics, optimized scripts)

### Total Blocking Time (TBT)
- **Target**: <300ms
- **Current**: 321ms
- **Expected**: ~250-280ms (deferred script loading)

### Performance Score
- **Current**: 88/100
- **Expected**: 90-95/100

## Additional Recommendations

1. **Image Optimization**
   - Convert existing images to WebP/AVIF format
   - Ensure images are properly sized (don't serve 1920px images for 640px displays)
   - Consider adding image CDN for further optimization

2. **Content Delivery Network**
   - Vercel Edge Network automatically provides CDN benefits
   - Images served through Next.js Image component are optimized

3. **Code Splitting**
   - Next.js automatically code-splits by route
   - Consider dynamic imports for heavy components if needed

4. **Server-Side Rendering**
   - Most pages are already server-rendered (except homepage)
   - Consider converting homepage to server component if possible (but keep interactive features)

5. **Font Subset Optimization**
   - Current fonts only load 'latin' subset (already optimized)
   - No additional font optimization needed

## Monitoring

After deployment, monitor:
- Google PageSpeed Insights
- Vercel Analytics
- Real User Monitoring (RUM) data
- Core Web Vitals in Google Search Console

## Testing

Test the optimized site using:
- Google PageSpeed Insights: https://pagespeed.web.dev/
- Lighthouse in Chrome DevTools
- WebPageTest: https://www.webpagetest.org/

All optimizations maintain SEO benefits while improving performance metrics.
