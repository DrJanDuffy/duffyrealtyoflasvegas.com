# Images Directory

This directory should contain the following images scraped from the Beazer Las Vegas page:

1. **henderson-city-hall.jpg** - Henderson, Nevada image (e.g., Henderson NV City Hall.jpg from Beazer site)
2. **las-vegas-strip.jpg** - Las Vegas Strip image from Beazer site
3. **boulder-city-downtown.jpg** - Boulder City downtown image (e.g., Boulder City NV - Downtown.jpg)
4. **mesquite-golf.jpg** - Mesquite golf course image (e.g., Mesquite NV - Golf.jpg)

## Instructions

Since the Beazer website loads images dynamically via JavaScript, you'll need to:

1. Visit https://www.beazer.com/las-vegas-NV
2. Open browser DevTools (F12) and go to Network tab
3. Filter by "Img" to see image requests
4. Find the images for:
   - Henderson (City Hall image)
   - Las Vegas Strip
   - Boulder City (Downtown)
   - Mesquite (Golf)
5. Right-click each image and "Save image as..." to this directory with the names above

Alternatively, you can:
- Use browser extensions to download images
- Take screenshots of the images
- Contact Beazer for high-resolution versions

The landing page will work without these images (they just won't display), but adding them will complete the design.
